# Hello World - base R

## Welcome

Welcome to the R visualization workshop. If you are completely new to R
and need to find something in the RStudio environment, check out this
[cheat
sheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/main/rstudio-ide.pdf).

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. You can
toggle its appearance by clicking *Source* or *Visual* at the top of the
script tab (or by clicking on the gear symbol and (de-)selecting 'Use
Visual Editor'). The aim of this notebook is to familiarize yourself
with this format. It will also check whether the functions you need for
today are working.

### Interacting with R

Within a workbook, you can interact with R in two ways:

-   the traditional way: typing commands or code into the Console that
    you usually find in the bottom left window in RStudio. The `>` at
    the beginning of a line is called a 'prompt'. You can only type
    commands, when you see the prompt. If you gave a command, and there
    is no prompt, it means R is still calculating. Results from entering
    commands in the console appear in the console (except for e.g.
    plots, which appear in their own window).

-   You can also interact with R via the R Markdown Notebook: The
    notebook consists of two types of text, markdown as this text, and
    code 'chunks'. These chunks can be executed (see the little symbols
    at the top of the chunks below). When you execute code within the
    notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

Try executing the chunk below by clicking the *Run* button within the
chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing
*Cmd+Shift+Enter*.

```{r 00helloWorld, echo=FALSE}
print("Hello World.") #comments behind a hashtag are ignored

plot(-8:8,(-8:8)^2,type="l",ylim=c(0,200),ann=F,axes=F) #the mouth

points(c(-5,5),rep(150,2),cex=5) #the eyes

points(c(-5,5),rep(145,2),cex=2,pch=16) #the pupils
```

### Chunks
You can add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the
toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*. You could do this for example to
see what happens if you change some code without loosing the original.
For example, try to copy some code from above into a new chunk below and
move the eyes or change the mouth. *Note: You can't have the same name
for two chunks in the same file, so you need to change the name when
copying, i.e. the word behind r.*

## Test 'knitting'
A cool feature of notebooks is that you can produce an HTML file from
them that contains the text, code, and outputs. You can use this as your
data report. To produce an HTML file containing the code and output, you
can click the *Knit* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K*.
[Here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/main/rmarkdown.pdf)'s
a quick summary of R markdown. Refer to the [R markdown
guidelines](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/r-code.html) to learn
more on how to control the chunks' appearance in the final output. You
will see examples in the following notebooks, too.

Knit this markdown to test that everything is working fine for you.
*Note: If you get the error message* **Duplicate chunk label...** *, you
forgot to change the chunk labels/names.*

```{r 00libraries}
if(!require(RColorBrewer)){
  install.packages("RColorBrewer",repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
  library(RColorBrewer)
}
if(!require(openxlsx)){
  install.packages("openxlsx",repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
  library(openxlsx)
}
```

Here should be a list of files we provided you:

```{r 00rawDir, echo=FALSE}
currentDir <- "../datasets"
list.files(currentDir)
```

Ask the instructor, if something does not work.
